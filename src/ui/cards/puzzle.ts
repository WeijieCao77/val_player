/**
 * The colour under everything.
 *
 * Faces, crests and agents are cut-outs on a transparent background — 490
 * of the 551 faces, every crest, every agent. Painted onto a transparent
 * canvas, that transparency went into the bitmap. On the page the box's
 * panel showed through it, so in the dark theme dark hair sank into a dark
 * ground; but 「复制图片」 hands over the bitmap with its alpha, and pasted
 * onto a white chat window the silhouette — hair, head, shoulders — stood
 * out crisp against white, coarsened or not. The light themes gave the same
 * outline on the page itself, which made 浅 and 米 easier than 深.
 *
 * So the frame is painted on an opaque ground first, fixed per picture and
 * the same on every theme: the picture's own average colour, weighted by
 * alpha, which is on average the one colour the subject's edge contrasts
 * with least. What is copied is now exactly what is on the page.
 *
 * That was the whole rule for a day, and it broke half the crests. A face
 * or an agent has colours of its own — skin, hair, a jersey — and shows
 * against its average by them; but forty of the seventy-eight crests are
 * one flat colour cut out of nothing, and their average IS that colour.
 * JD Gaming was a red frame with a red crest on it, invisible even in the
 * clear; the black crests were a black box; the group sent five of them.
 *
 * So the ground is pushed away from the picture by as much of the picture
 * as would vanish into it. `flat` is the share of the picture (by alpha)
 * that sits within 45 of its average colour — a face is 0.1–0.4, a crest
 * with a gradient or a second colour under 0.3, a flat crest 0.94–1 — with
 * a knee from 0.5 to 0.9 so an ordinary face moves by nothing. A flat
 * picture's ground is its colour half-way to a light grey (dark pictures)
 * or a dark grey (light ones): JD Gaming's red sits on a dusty rose, a
 * black crest on a mid grey, the Loud green on a darker green. Not the RMS
 * spread of the colours, which was tried first: a small red star on a
 * navy crest gave it a spread a face would have, and the navy stayed on
 * navy.
 *
 * A picture that fills its own box — a map, one of the 61 photographed
 * faces — is exempt: there the ground's job is to hide the box's edge, and
 * only the average does that.

/**
 * The frame at this many cells of detail.
 *
 * Three of the four kinds are square — faces 192², agents 128², crests 256²
 * — and only a map is a 4.55:1 strip, so a frame that cropped or letterboxed
 * gave the kind away from across the room. The picture is drawn whole and
 * contained on a backdrop of itself blown up past the box and washed out,
 * and then the whole frame is coarsened together: at the opening six cells
 * the strip's edges and the backdrop are one smudge, and they separate only
 * as the misses buy detail. Everything sits on an opaque ground — see
 * groundOf — so the bitmap carries no alpha for a copy to expose.
 *
 * The backdrop fades with the picture's flatness. A flat crest blown up is
 * the same flat colour over most of the frame, and a crest drawn on top of
 * that was drawn on itself; the ground has been chosen to show it, so for
 * a flat picture the ground is all there is behind it.
