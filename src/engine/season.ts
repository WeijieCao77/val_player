 *
 *   The warning was withdrawn only on a top-four finish. A mid-table club is
 *   asked for top eight, so a manager could meet the brief four stages
 *   running, watch confidence climb from 40% to 88%, and still be carrying a
 *   warning that costs 45 points of odds on every renewal and job offer. It
 *   never came off, and nothing on screen said what would take it off.
 *
 *   And the sack could fire on a stage that PASSED, because the confidence
 *   floor did not ask. The manager was then told he had 「又交了一个不合格
