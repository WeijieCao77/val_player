/**
 * 每日挑战 — one puzzle a day, the same one for everybody.
 *
 * The card mode's problem is not that it gives too little, it is that a
 * session is structurally four minutes long: sign in, open a pack, watch seven
 * fifteen-second matches, done. Measured, half the people who make an account
 * never come back — and no amount of tuning the pack drip fixes a game that
 * runs out of things to do before the coffee is cold.
 *
 * So: something to think about rather than something to watch. The puzzle is
 * derived from the server's date, so every player on earth gets the same one
 * on the same day and can argue about it, and it resets whether or not you
 * solved it. Six guesses, each one narrowing the answer.
 *
 * Nothing here is invented. The four kinds are built from data the game
 * already ships and is already careful about: 518 real players with their real
 * clubs, nationalities, ages and roles; 78 real clubs; the 13 maps and 27
 * agents with the artwork already in public/. There is no weapons round for
 * exactly that reason — the game holds no weapon data, and a quiz that makes
 * its facts up is worse than no quiz.
