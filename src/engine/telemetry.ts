 *
 * Identity is a random id generated in the browser on first visit. The server
 * never sees or stores an IP address. Two consequences worth stating plainly:
 * clearing site data makes someone a new person, and two people sharing a
 * phone are one person. For "did anyone come back", that is far more accurate
 * than an IP — Chinese carriers put hundreds of users behind one address and
 * move a single user between several in an evening.
 *
 * Nothing here can break the game. Every entry point swallows its own errors,
