/**
 * How differently a side can turn up from one map to the next.
 *
 * Rounds were independent draws around a fixed strength, and twenty-four
 * independent draws hide nothing: the higher-rated side won 77% of series
 * against a club 3-5 rating points below it, 86% against one 6-9 below,
 * and a club that assembled a strong five never lost again — 「一旦组成一个
 * 强队就根本没有输的可能性」. Two dials moved. Each side's strength on a map
 * carries a draw of this spread for the whole map, so a weaker side's good
 * day is a whole map rather than a round; and the round curve (ROUND_SENS
 * below) is flatter, so a strength gap decides a map less completely. Just
 * widening the swing made maps lopsided — 46% of them 13-5 or worse — which
 * is why most of the change is in the curve: 3-5 below now wins 30% of
 * series, 6-9 below 20%, and one map in four is a 13-5, as in the real
 * thing. Measured with scratch scripts over three seasons; the smoke test
 * still holds the K/D calibration.
