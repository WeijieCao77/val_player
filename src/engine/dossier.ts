/**
 * Everything about a real player that is not a number the match engine reads:

 *
 * Kept apart from world.json on purpose. That file is the simulation's input
 * and every byte of it is loaded into every save; this is reference material
 * the dossier screen and the card faces read, and nothing in the season loop
 * touches it.
 *
 * Split in two for the same reason. Every card drawn needs a face, a flag and
 * a name, so those 45KB ride along with the bundle. The club histories and the
 * 1,673 tournaments behind them are 850KB that only the dossier screen ever
 * opens — paying for that on first visit would have roughly doubled the
 * download for everybody, so `records.json` is fetched on demand.
 *
 * Built by scripts/build_dossier.py from vlr.gg player pages (photo, flag,
 * placements, winnings) and Liquipedia's team history.
