/**
 * What a five IS, read off the agents it takes onto the map — and what that
 * shape does to the sliders, the timeout calls and the opponent.
 *
 * Until now the four tactical dials were the same four numbers for every
 * composition, and they nearly cancelled: aggression 100 was worth +1.4 on
 * attack and −0.75 on defence, which measured out at +0.4 points of map win
 * rate. The only setting that moved anything was 道具, and it moved the same
 * way for everybody, so the honest strategy was "drag everything right". That
 * is a dial with one correct position, which is not a decision. The group
 * chat said so: 「战术板的四个滑杆跟比赛胜负关系不大，阵容也跟胜负关系不大」.
 *
 * Real compositions have a shape, and the shape decides what the sliders can
 * buy. Pro data (thespike / rib / vlr composition tables, 2025 season):
 *
 *   双决斗 (2 duelists)     tempo and chaos — about 54% over the season,
 *                            58.8% in Pacific at 2026 Kickoff, lives on winning
 *                            duels; attack-leaning, thin on defence
 *   双控场 (2 controllers)  Omen + Viper was the dominant pair of 2025 —
 *                            methodical map control, pays on both sides, and
 *                            it is the utility budget that feeds it
 *   双哨卫 (2 sentinels)    setups and retakes — a defensive shape, slower,
 *                            punishes anyone who runs into it
 *   标准 (1D 2I 1C 1S)      the forgiving formula every map's default is
 *
 * So the engine reads the five's shape and scales the dials by it: 节奏 and
 * 侵略性 pay roughly double on a double-duelist five and cost double on a
 * double-sentinel one, 道具 is what a double-controller five is built on. And
 * the OPPONENT's shape decides what your dials run into — fast pace into a
 * double-sentinel setup is what loses the pistol, an aggressive defence
 * against two duelists gets run over.
 *
 * Nothing here is a number the manager cannot act on: every term is either
 * a slider, an agent pick, or the opponent's sheet.
