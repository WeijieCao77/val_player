 * the final is always the hardest club the draw could find, and the final is
 * a best of five.
 *
 * The purse is shaped for that: a little for going out early, more for
 * every round survived, and a title worth more the longer the road was. Per
 * point of 体力 it lands near the ladder for a five that goes out in the
