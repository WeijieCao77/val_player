/**
 * One id for the whole site.
 *
 * The card mode already had an account: twenty characters of Crockford base32,
 * no email and no password, held in localStorage and mirrored to a server row
 * keyed by its SHA-256. That id is now the site's id rather than one game's —
 * the manager's endings, achievements and lifetime numbers hang off the same
 * string, so a player who screenshots it once keeps everything.
 *
 * Deliberately kept OUT of the card mode's save. The two games are written by
 * different hands and change at different rates, and a profile that lived
 * inside `GachaState` would mean every ending written from the manager races
 * the card mode's own saves for the same row. So this is its own row, its own
 * endpoint and its own revision counter, and the only thing the two share is
 * the id itself — read from account.ts, never written by this file.
 *
 * Local first, always. The server is a copy that lets the profile follow a
 * player to another device; every read falls back to localStorage and every
 * write lands there first, so the whole thing works with no network at all.
