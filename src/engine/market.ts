/**
 * The trading post, from this side of the wire.
 *
 * The accounting rule is the same one the server enforces: you pay in when you
 * act and collect afterwards. Listing takes the card off your side now;
 * offering takes the coins. Everything that comes back — a sale, a refund, a
 * card that did not sell — arrives through the inbox.
 *
 * None of that is applied here any more. The server takes the card out of the
 * collection when it lists it, takes the coins when it bids, and puts mail
 * into the collection when it is collected — and hands the account back each
 * time. This file only asks.
