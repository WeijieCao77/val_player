 * that it is the only way to train the caller. Setting the same player's

 * is from being a finished IGL rather than sitting flat — which is also the
 * case that was reported, a converted IGL whose 指挥 started low.
 *
 * Measured: a caller in the fifties takes about two rounds a point, the
 * seventies about four, the high eighties about five, and the ceiling on the
 * curve is deliberately low enough that the fastest anyone learns is a point a
 * fortnight. A season of nothing but tape work takes a poor caller to an
 * average one; it cannot take an average one to a great one, and 指挥 buys
